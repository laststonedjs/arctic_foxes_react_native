# Arctic foxes
<hr/>
###

To start the application, it is necessary to issue the command 'npm start' from the root directory ('arctic_foxes_rn') and expo will generate a QR code for scanning (expo-go app - we can download it from the play store).

<hr/>

Go deeper and get to know my pets from the far north of the planet, this application also offers you the possibility of inserting, 
deleting and changing existing foxes from the list. Without a backend, I use data from a local <json> file.

Enjoy and give me a star if you like it!
