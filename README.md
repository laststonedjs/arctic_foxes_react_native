# ðŸ¦Š Arctic Foxes ðŸ¦Š (React Native, Expo-Go application)
<hr/>

To start the application, it is necessary to start the command: <br/>
```npm start``` from the root directory (dir_name: 'arctic_foxes_rn') and Metro will generate a QR code for scanning (Expo-Go App - we can download it from the play store).

<hr/>
Go deeper and get to know my pets from the far north of the planet, this application also offers you the possibility of inserting, 
deleting and changing existing foxes from the list. Without a backend, I use data object from a local <i>dummyData.js</i> file.

```Goals and Achievements during the construction of the project```
Through this task and challenge, the biggest challenge for me was sending data between components and calling them through various dynamic forms, cards and lists. Thoroughly reading the react-native documentation, I learned a lot more about FlatList (many of its props), native navigation and, among other things, the search functionality that I implemented on the 'Home' page. As for the 'Details' page, you can find larger pictures, more descriptions with text, as well as our editing section.

For fonts used this great Inter typeface open source font family!

/** 
* Note 
*/
When scanning the QR code with the <i>Expo-Go</i> application, your mobile phone must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the PC.

Enjoy and give me a star if you like it! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
